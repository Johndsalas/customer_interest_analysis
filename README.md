# Purpose: 

Describe how differing interest groups influence customer purchasing decisions at a local game store in 2023 and make recommendations for increasing sales

# Wrangle 

I began the project with data that I pre-prepared in a different repository. The data contained a history of customer transactions with columns describing the number of items bought in each of 9 categories and the net sales of each purchase.  

**Area of interest categories include:**
* Board Games 
* Role Playing Games
* Trading Card Games
* Tabletop Minis Games
* Modeling Supplies
<a/>

**Support Categories include:**
* Accessories
* Concessions
* Game Room Rentals
<a/>

**Items that could not be classified**
* Other
<a/>

The data was then restricted to purchases made in 2023 and aggregated by customer to get total values for each category and net spending for purchases made in 2023. After exploring the data I was able to draw the following conclusions and make the following recommendations.

# Conclusion

This local game store serves a wide variety of customers both in terms of interest and spending. Roughly ⅓ of total customers or less have made a purchase from categories representing major gaming interests and the top 11% of spenders account for 60% of total net sales for the store. The following discussion describes groups of gamers that have made at least one purchase in each category. There is significant overlap between groups.

Board gamers have the most diversified interests as board games do not share a strong relationship with many other categories, though they are more likely to buy role playing games than non-board gamers.

Trading card gamers are more likely to stay within their own group as there is a significant negative relationship between trading card games and every other interest group. However they are likely the store's largest source of revenue as they make up the store’s largest interest group and make up 70% of the store's top spending customers. Gamers in this group are more likely to buy accessories and concessions than gamers not in this group.

Role playing gamers are likely a major driver of sales in other categories. Role playing gamers are nearly 3 times as likely to buy accessories, 4 times as likely to buy minis models, and 2 times as likely to buy modeling supplies as non-role playing gamers. Role playing gamers spend the most on average and are the smallest customer group.

Minis models gamers likely comprised primarily of “war gamers” and “role playing gamers,” each buying models to support their respective interests. Strong driver of modeling supplies as they are 8 times as likely to buy modeling supplies as non-mini’s models gamers. 

Modeling supplies gamers are those who like to assemble, paint, and otherwise decorate the models used in their games. Strongly connected with minis models sales of each likely drive sales of the other though the stronger direction is likely minis models to minis supplies. Gamers in this group are 8 times more likely to buy minis models.

## Recommendations

Continue to promote trading card games as this is likely the store's largest source of revenue. Gamers from this group are the store’s largest interest group and make up 70% of the store's top spending customers. Attempt to cross-sale related accessories such as sleeves, playmats, and binders to increase sales. Gamers in this group have an increased likelihood to buy accessories.

Begin initiative to promote role playing games. Role playing games drive purchases in other categories particularly accessories, minis models, and modeling supplies. Role players also spend more on average than any other interest group and are the smallest in number. For these reasons I believe attracting more gamers in this group represents the greatest possibility for increasing sales. Popular organized activities such as D&D Adventure League might be a good way to do this. Attempt to cross-sell related accessories and models. Gamers in this group are 3-4 times more likely to buy these items than non-role playing gamers.
